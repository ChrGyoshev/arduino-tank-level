# Fuel Level Monitor System using Arduino Uno and Ultrasonic Sensor

This project is a fuel level monitoring system built using an Arduino Uno, a 16x2 LCD display with I2C interface, and an ultrasonic sensor. The system measures the fuel level in a tank and displays it on the LCD screen in real-time.

## Introduction

Fuel level monitoring systems are essential in various industries, including automotive, agriculture, and manufacturing. This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for monitoring fuel levels using readily available components and Arduino microcontrollers.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD Display with I2C interface
- Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- Power Source (e.g., USB cable, battery)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Connect the Components:**
   - Connect the I2C LCD display to the Arduino Uno as per the provided datasheets or pinout diagrams.
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino Uno. Typically, the sensor requires connections for VCC, GND, Trig, and Echo pins.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - If you haven't already, install the necessary libraries for the LCD display and ultrasonic sensor. You can find these libraries in the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

3. **Upload the Code:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`fuel_level_monitor.ino`) to your Arduino Uno board using the Arduino IDE or any other compatible software.

4. **Power Up:**
   - Power up your Arduino Uno using a suitable power source.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete and the code is uploaded to the Arduino board, the system will start monitoring the fuel level in real-time. The LCD display will show the current fuel level, updating it as the level changes.
